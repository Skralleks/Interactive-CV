# Interactive-CV
Create stateless CV, which can only be developed on run time. By using html form, javascript and jquery control/events and css.

In the start CV page will show only form but corresponding elements for CV fields will show as the user start filling the form CV will start building.

Note: stateless means CV will be gone when you refresh the page.
